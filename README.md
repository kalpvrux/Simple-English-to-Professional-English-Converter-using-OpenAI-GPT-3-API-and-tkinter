# Simple English to Professional English Converter using OpenAI GPT-3 API and tkinter
This is a Python script that converts a simple English sentence to professional English using the OpenAI GPT-3 API and the tkinter module. The user enters a simple English sentence in a tkinter window, and the script sends it to the OpenAI API for conversion. The converted professional English sentence is then displayed in the same window.

Getting Started
To use this script, you need to install the following Python packages:

OpenAI
tkinter
You can install these packages using pip, the Python package manager.

```
pip install openai tkinter
```

You also need an OpenAI API key, which you can get by creating an account on the OpenAI website. The script is designed to use the Davinci engine of the OpenAI API, which is the most powerful and accurate engine. However, it requires a paid subscription to OpenAI. If you don't have a subscription, you can use the GPT-3 API's other engines like Curie, Babbage, Ada, etc.

Usage
To use the script, simply run the Python file simple-to-professional.py. A tkinter window will appear, where you can enter a simple English sentence and click the "Convert" button to convert it to professional English. The converted sentence will appear in the same window.

```
python simple-to-professional.py
```
